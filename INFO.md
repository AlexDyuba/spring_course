# Terms
Bean - it is nothing more than the most common object. The only difference is that beans are usually called those objects that are managed by Spring and live inside its DI container.
# Annotation
@Component - is an annotation that allows Spring to automatically detect our custom beans.
@Qualifier - by using the @Qualifier annotation, we can eliminate the issue of which bean needs to be injected.
